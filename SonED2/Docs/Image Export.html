Most graphical data used in SonED2 can be exported to image files. All output
files are 256-color TGA files of the sizes determined by the type and
amount of data to export. These options appear in the "Misc" menu under
"Export to image", according to the type of Project that is currently loaded:<br>

<ul>
 <li><a href="#Tiles">Tiles</a>
 <li><a href="#Blocks">Blocks</a>

<br><a name="Level">
<b>Standard Level Projects</b><br>
<ul>
<a name="Tiles">
 <b>Tiles</b><br>
 <br>
 <ul>
  8x8 Tiles are dumped in vertical list format running in 4 columns,
  one for each palette row variation.<br>
 </ul>

 <br>
 <br><a name="Blocks">
 <b>Blocks</b><br>
 <br>
 <ul>
  16x16 Blocks are dumped in vertical list format, running 1 column.<br>
 </ul>

 <br>
 <br><a name="Chunks">
 <b>Chunks</b><br>
 <br>
 <ul>
  Chunks are dumped in a vertical list, running 2 columns.<br>
 </ul>

 <br>
 <br><a name="Solidity">
 <b>Solidity</b><br>
 <br>
 <ul>
  Solidity is dumped in a chart format running 20 entries wide,
  displaying each Height Map and its corresponding Angle value.<br>
 </ul>

 <br>
 <br><a name="Map">
 <b>Level Maps</b><br>
 <br>
 <ul>
  Level maps are dumped as a full image, as seen by scrolling
  through them in SonED2 or in-game. Either one of the two
  planes (A, foreground or B, background) can be dumped with
  only "High" priority tiles, only "Low" priority tiles, or both showing.<br>
  <br>Plane
  A dumps can also take advantage of the following additional output settings,
  which must be toggled within the drop-down menu prior to selecting Plane A for exporting:<br>
