<br>
"Project Files" are the files that must be selected by the user to begin
editing. These files list the filenames of the data files required for
any editing project and any relevant settings values. The files use the
extension ".sep" to identify them as "SonED Project Files", but they are
plain text files that can be opened in any text editor.<br>

<br><a name="Formatting">
<b>Formatting</b><br>
<ul>
The basic formatting for "Project File" data is as follows:<br>
<ul>
<pre>Description: Data</pre>
</ul>
"Description" may be any text that specifies the data type required on each line.
It is completely ignored by the program and may say anything. The
colon (:) marks the beginning of the data for each line. Data is only
read between a colon and a newline, so anything on the following lines
is regarded as a description/comment and is ignored until another colon is
found.<br>
<br>
It is suggested that the following line appear at the bottom of every
"Project File":<br>
<ul>
<pre>-EOF-</pre></ul>
Adding this line to the bottom of the file ensures that the last data
line contains a newline character. If the final data line does not
include a newline, the project interpreter may crash. Newline must
be present because it marks the end of the dataline.<br>
</ul>
<br><a name="Type">
<b>Project Type</b><br>
<ul>
The first entry in any "Project File" is always the project type specifier.
Valid type specifiers are:<br>
<br><ul>
<li><b><a href="Project Types/Level.html">Level</a></b> - Standard gameplay level<br>
<li><b><a href="Project Types/S1SS.html">S1SS</a></b> - Sonic 1 Rotating Special Stage<br>
</ul><br>
Different project types require different data, so the exact format of the
"Project File" is dependent on the type specifier. If
the proper format is not used, either the data will load improperly, or
SonED2 may crash.<br>
</ul>
<br><a name="New">
<b>Creating New Data</b><br>
<ul>
If any data file referenced by the "Project File" does not exist, the corresponding
data will be blanked out upon "load", and the file will be created with the data
created in SonED upon project save. If a path is given with the filename, the
path <b>must</b> already exist.<br>
</ul>
<br><a name="Compression">
<b>Data Compression Types</b><br>
<ul>
Many types of data can use some form of compression, and the Project Files will require that the compression
type be specified. The following are the valid compression type values:<br>
<ul><br>
<table>
<tr><td><b>0</b></td><td> - </td><td>No Compression</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>1</b></td><td> - </td><td>"Kosinski"</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>2</b></td><td> - </td><td>"Enigma"</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>3</b></td><td> - </td><td>"Nemesis"</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>4</b></td><td> - </td><td>"Saxman"</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>5</b></td><td> - </td><td>Moduled "Kosinski"</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
