<b><center>SonED2 Tile Editor</center></b><br>
<br>
The tile editor is used for editing each component of the tiles that make
up normal gameplay levels, including the palette colors and solidity maps.<br>
<br>
Levels are built in several steps, beginning with 8x8 Tile graphics.
The 64-color palette is divided into four sub-palettes (referred to here as "rows"),
and each 8x8 Tile may only use colors from any one of those rows (for a total of 15
color choices, with the first entry in each row being transparent). In the Sonic the
Hedgehog games, the first color entry on row 3 controls the "Backdrop Color". This is
the color that appears where nothing else is drawn to the screen, including the screen
borders displayed by some system versions, and can be taken advantage of to use a full
set of 16 colors for the background.<br>
<br>
The Tiles are then formed into 16x16 "Blocks", which contain drawing direction and
palette row ID data for each Tile, and the ID of the Solidity Height Map that
should be used to set which parts of the block are "solid".<br>
<br>
The Blocks are used to build "Chunks", which are either 256x256 or 128x128, depending
on the project settings and the target game. These Chunks contain data for each Block
that defines drawing direction and the type of reaction a player should have to the
Block's assigned Height Map.<br>
<br>
Finally, the Chunks are used to build the level layout.<br>
<br>
Solidity Height Maps define the parts of a Block that are "solid" (that the player can collide
with), and are based on the idea that each pixel column along the width of a
Block can be filled up to a certain height, where the player will be made to stand on
it (or, if it is beside him, be made to act as if it is a solid wall). The Height Maps
also contain Angle values that determine how gravity affects the player's velocity while
he is standing on or running along the Height Map. This data, however,
does not have any affect on the player unless the "Solidity Type" of the
Block is set within the Chunk.<br>
<br>
All of the above-described data can be created by altering
existing data, by starting from scratch within the editor, or the Tile art
and palette data can be created outside of SonED2 and imported from an image, however,
the image must be set up as described in the <a href="Art Importing.html">art importing document</a> to obtain useful results.<br>

<br>
<br><a name="Tileset">
<b>Tileset Controls</b><br>
<br>
<ul>
There are a few generic commands that apply to all Tile/Solidity editing
sections of this editing mode. They are applied to the editor over which the cursor is
currently hovering and the tile that is currently selected therein, or in the case of
the Tile Selector, the Tile/Block/Chunk/Solid that is currently being pointed to.<br>
<br>
<a name="Expand">
<b>Expand List</b><br>
<ul><br>Increase the size of a tile listing by adding a new tile to
              the end. When hovering the cursor over the desired tile type,
              <b>hold CTRL and press A</b>. If the list contains more than one
              page, one of the individual pages must be selected, as opposed
              to "Page X" (all pages)</ul><br>

<br>
<a name="Contract">
<b>Contract List</b><br>
<ul><br>Decrease the size of a tile listing by removing the tile at
                the end. When hovering the cursor over the desired tile
                type, <b>hold CTRL and press Z</b>. If the list contains more than
                one page, one of the individual pages must be selected, as
                opposed to "Page X" (all pages)</ul><br>

<br>
<a name="Insert">
<b>Insert</b><br>
<ul><br>Insert a new tile into the list in front of the selected tile.
         When hovering the cursor over the desired tile of the desired type,
         <b>hold CTRL and press I</b>. Larger tiles and level layout are updated to
         reflect the new listing order</ul><br>

<br>
<a name="Delete">
<b>Delete</b><br>
<ul><br>Delete the currently selected tile from the list. When hovering the
         cursor over the desired tile of the desired type, <b>hold CTRL and
         press D</b>. Larger tiles and level layout are updated to reflect the
         new listing order. Positions occupied by the deleted tile are
         set to "0"</ul><br>

<br>
<a name="Copy">
<b>Copy</b><br>
<ul><br>Copy the currently selected tile for later pasting. When hovering the
       cursor over the desired tile of the desired type, <b>hold CTRL and press
       C</b>. Copied tiles of different types are stored separately</ul><br>

<br>
<a name="Paste">
<b>Paste</b><br>
<ul><br>Paste the last tile of the selected type that was copied to the
        currently selected tile. When hovering the cursor over the desired
        tile of the desired type, <b>hold CTRL and press P</b></ul><br>

<br>
<a name="Mirror">
<b>Mirror</b><br>
<ul><br>Reverse the currently selected tile horizontally. When hovering the
         cursor over the desired tile of the desired type, <b>hold CTRL and
         press M</b>. When a Tile or Block is mirrored, its drawing direction
         in any Block or Chunk that it appears in is updated so that it has
         no visible effect. This is useful for Blocks in particular, to
         avoid having to draw new Solidity Maps that are just reversed
         versions of existing ones. <i>To prevent the Block/Chunk from being
         updated with the Tile/Block, <b>hold Spacebar</b></i></ul><br>

<br>
<a name="Flip">
<b>Flip</b><br>
<ul><br>Reverse the currently selected tile vertically. When hovering the
       cursor over the desired tile of the desired type, <b>hold CTRL and
       press F</b>. When a Tile or Block is flipped, its drawing direction
       in any Block or Chunk that it appears in is updated so that it has
       no visible effect. This is useful for Blocks in particular, to
       avoid having to draw new Solidity Maps that are just reversed
       versions of existing ones. <i>To prevent the Block/Chunk from being
       updated with the Tile/Block, <b>hold Spacebar</b></i></ul><br>
</ul>


<br>
<br><a name="Census">
<b>Tile Census</b><br>
<br>
<ul>
This section simply specifies the number of tiles of each type that currently
exist. <b>Left-clicking</b> on the name of any tile type will cause that
type to be displayed in the Tile Selector.<br>
</ul>


<br>
<br><a name="Selector">
<b>Tile Selector</b><br>
<br>
<ul>
The Tile Selector simply functions as a tool for selecting a tile of any
type to edit. The <b>Arrow Keys</b>, or the <b>scrollbar</b> (in windowed mode) can be
used to scroll the list up and down. <b>Left-click</b> the desired Tile to select
it for editing.<br>
<br>
Tile types are selected by clicking the tile type name in
the Tile Census area. When any tile type in the current project uses more
than one page, a selection for each page will appear below the Tile Census
area. <b>Left-clicking</b> "Page X" will cause the Tile Selector to list all tiles of
the current type from all pages. <b>Left-clicking</b> any of the other "Page" options
will limit the list to show only the tiles that are a part of the selected
page for the selected type.<br>
</ul>



<br>
<br><a name="Palette">
<b>Palette Editor</b><br>
<br>
<ul>
The palette editor serves as both the color selection tool and the color
editing tool. The currently-selected color is marked by a white box that
surrounds it. A level may only display 64 colors at once (the top 4 rows),
but the display shows 128 colors, with the bottom  4 rows being available for
creating "underwater" colors, or any other kind of alternate palette.<br>
<br><a name="Swap">
<b>Swap Palette</b><br>
<br><ul><b>Left-clicking</b> the "X" to the right of the palette will swap
               the two sections, displaying the level with the alternate
               palette<br></ul>


<br><a name="ChangeColor">
<b>Change Color</b><br>
<br><ul>The "R" "G" and "B" selections below the palette itself list the Red, Green, and
               Blue component values that make up the currently-selected color. <b>Left-click</b>
               one of the components to increase it, or <b>right-click</b> it to decrease<br>
               <br>
               Hovering over the desired color entry and pressing one of the following keys has the same effect:<br>
               <br>
                   <ul><table>
                   <tr><td><b>G/B</b></td><td> - </td><td>Decrease/Increase the Red component</td></tr>

               Using any of the above-listed keys will also automatically select the entry<br>
<br></ul>

<br><a name="AltPalette">
<b>Generate Alt Palette</b><br>
<br><ul>The color selection just to the right of the RGB options can be used
                       to generate a type of "alpha blend" palette, useful
                       for quickly creating "water" or other blend effects.
                       <b>Left-click</b> the color to select it for editing, and
                       then <b>Right-Click</b> it to generate an alternate palette

<br><a name="Solids">
<b>Solidity Editor</b><br>
<br>
<ul>
The Solidity Editor is used to edit the Height Maps that can be applied to
the 16x16 Blocks to give the effect that they are "solid". Height Maps do
not correspond directly with 16x16 tiles, instead, they are listed by
themselves, and each 16x16 Block is given an ID number that corresponds
with the Height Map it should use.<br>
<br>
Each Height Map also contains an Angle
value that determines the ammount and direction of force that is applied
to a player that stands on it. A value of 0xFF is used for flat ground, but
otherwise, all angles <i>must</i> be even values. A full range of 360 degrees is
represented by values between 0x00 and 0xFF (256 values), with 0x00 being 0/360
degrees, 0x40 being 90, 0x80 being 180, and 0xC0 being 270. Values starting at 0x00 and
rising are used starting at the bottom of a circle and moving clockwise
(left-side slopes use values between 0x00 and 0x3F from bottom-up, right
side are 0xFF to 0xC0 from bottom-up).<br>
<br>
The "Solid ID"
option shows the ID number of the currently-selected Height Map, and can
be <b>left-clicked or right-clicked</b> to select a different Height Map. The "Solids" option on the "Tile Census" may be
selected to cause the selection list at the right of the screen to display
Height Maps, which can be selected by <b>left-clicking</b> on them. The "<b>F</b>" and "<b>V</b>"
keys may also be used to cycle through available Height Maps.<br>
<br>
All generic commands listed
in the "Tileset Control" section above can be used when pointing within the Solidity, or when hovering over
a Height Map in the Tile Selector<br>

<br><ul>A Height Map is made up of 16 columns, representing the
                16 columns of a Block. Each column can be filled up (or
                down) to a certain height to specify which parts of the Block will be "solid".<br>
                <br>To fill
                a column from bottom up, <b>left-click</b> the heighest point that
                should be made "solid".<br>
                <br>To fill from top down, <b>right-click the</b>
                lowest point that should be made "solid".<br>

             <i>The
             Block shown doesn't necessarily correspond with the Height Map
             shown.</i> Because unique Height Maps should only be stored once,
             and multiple Blocks can reference the same Height Map,
             corresponding Blocks and Maps must be selected manually, and
             their relationship must be set manually.</ul><br>
