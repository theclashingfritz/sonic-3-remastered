<b><center>SonED2 Object Editor</center></b><br>
<br>
The Object Editor is used for editing the layout and properties of the Objects within the
normal gameplay levels. Objects are placed within levels by full X and Y
pixel offsets (coordinates), and also contain a type value and one or more
property values/bitfields, as well as a few generic flags, all of which
determine how the Object is displayed and how it behaves. The images and
descriptions displayed in the editor are set up through "Object Listing Files",
which tell the editor how each Object should be represented graphically, and
how its properties should be displayed and manipulated by the editing keys.
Those files may be altered and expanded upon as described by their own documentation.<br>

The Status Display appears at the upper-left corner of the editor and displays certain general level and editor
information, as well as information about any Object that the mouse cursor is hovering over.<br>
<br>
This display may be toggled off and back on by pressing "<b>Tab</b>".<br>

<a name="Moving">
<b>Moving an Object</b><br>
<ul><br>To move an Object that already exists, <b>click and drag</b> the
                   Object to its new location. The Object will move along
                   the grid set up by the "Snap-To-Grid" seting. If that
                   setting is 1, the Object will move freely<br>
                   <br>
                   To move the Object one pixel-unit at a time using the
                   keyboard, <b>hover over the Object</b> with the cursor,
                   <b>hold ctrl</b> and <b>press the arrow key</b> that
                   corresponds with the desired direction. The hotkey repeat
                   timer applies to this method, and this method also ignores
                   the "Snap-To-Grid" setting</ul>

<br>
<br>
<a name="Adding">
<b>Adding an Object</b><br>
<ul><br>To create a new Object, <b>double-left-click</b> any empty
                   position in a level, and a "null" Object will appear, which
                   can be changed into any other type of Object<br>
                   <br>
                   To create a new Ring, <b>double-right-click</b> any empty position

                   <br>
                   To create a new "Misc" Object, <b>hold Ctrl while double-left-clicking</b> any empty position
                   in the level</ul>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Removing">
<b>Removing an Object</b><br>
<ul><br>To remove an Object of any type from the level,

<br>
<br>
<a name="Type">
<b>Selecting Object Type</b><br>
<ul><br>To select the type of an Object by using the Object Type
                        Selection List, <b>double-left-click</b> the desired Object. When the
                        list appears, scroll to the description of the desired
                        Object type and left-click. To exit the list without
                        changing the Object's type, right-click instead</ul>
<br>

<a name="Property">
<b>Object Properties</b><br>
<ul><br>Object properties may be directly altered by whole value by

                    </table></ul><br>
                    Pressing these keys alone changes the value by 1, but holding
                    ctrl will change the value by 16</ul>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Bitfields">
<b>Object Bitfields</b><br>
<ul><br>When an Object's "Property" value is actually a group of smaller values
                   stored in a single byte, it can be broken into "bitfields" representing
                   each individual value. There can be up to 8 bitfields depending
                   on how large each one is. To modify the value in a bitfield,
                   press its corresponding <b>number key</b> (the field's ID + 1, IE:
                   field 0's key is 1) to add 1. <b>Hold Ctrl</b> while pressing the key
                   to subtract 1<br>
                   <br>
                   When no bitfields are defined for the Object type within the Object Listing File,
                   these keys will correspond to each individual bit in the full Property value<br>
                   <br>
                   When working with Sonic Crackers/Knuckles' Chaotix, <b>holding Shift</b> while pressing
                   the number key will allow access to the upper 8 bits, or the 9th bitfield and above</ul>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Flags">
<b>Common Object Flags</b><br>
<ul><br>All Objects have 4 generic flags, which are slightly different from
               game to game:<br>
               <br>
               <li>Sonic 1 and Sonic CD use two for drawing direction. "Remember Object State" is stored elsewhere<br>
               <li>Sonic 2 uses three of them. One for "Remember Object State", and two for draw direction<br>
               <li>Sonic 3 uses two of them for drawing direction, it does not use a "Remember Object State" flag<br>
               <li>Sonic Crackers and Knuckles' Chaotix do not use draw direction or "Remember Object State" settings<br>
               <br>
               To change the drawing direction of an Object,
               press <b>9</b>. <b>Holding Ctrl</b> will cycle through in reverse.
               To modify the "Remember Object State" flag, which
               causes destroyed Objects to stay destroyed, press <b>0</b>. To modify the
               "Unknown" flag, <b>hold Ctrl while pressing 0</b></ul>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Flags2">
<b>Sonic CD Time Flags</b><br>
<ul><br>Sonic CD assigns three additional flags to each Object, which determine whether or not they show up in each of
               the three time periods (past, present, or good/bad future). When these types of Objects are loaded, the
               Project File requires an additional setting that determines the default time period viewing flag to be
               set when the editor is started, the idea being that one project exists for each time period, and only
               Objects that will appear in that time period during gameplay will appear in the editor by default. The
               editor may, however, be instructed to display Objects for a different time period, or more than one time period
               at a time. The following keys control the time period(s) assigned to an Object, and the time period(s) whose
               Objects will be displayed in the editor:<br><br>
                    <ul><table>
                    <tr><td><b>Shift+1</b></td><td> - </td><td>Toggle editor display for "Present" (A)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><b>Shift+2</b></td><td> - </td><td>Toggle editor display for "Past" (B)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><b>Shift+3</b></td><td> - </td><td>Toggle editor display for "Future" (C/D)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><b>Shift+4</b></td><td> - </td><td>Toggle Object flag for "Present" (A)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><b>Shift+5</b></td><td> - </td><td>Toggle Object flag for "Past" (B)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><b>Shift+6</b></td><td> - </td><td>Toggle Object flag for "Future" (C/D)</td></tr>
                    </table></ul><br>
               Remember that, when an Object's time period flags are modified, if it is not flagged for one of the
               time periods that the editor is currently set to display, the Object will immediately "Disappear". The
               Object still exists within the Object Layout data, however, and will appear in any of the other time periods
               that it is flagged for. To "bring the Object back", the editor must be set to view any of the time periods
               for which the Object is still flagged. Objects must be flagged for at least one time period; any one time
               period flag may not be disabled unless at least one other flag is enabled.</ul>
