<br>
The Level Editor is used for editing the layout of normal gameplay levels.
Levels are built by placing "Chunks" onto the level grid with the cursor.
"Chunks" can be either 256 or 128 pixels in both width and height depending
on the target game, and are built from 16x16 "Blocks", which are
built from 8x8 Tiles. They can all be built and modified from within the <a href="Tile Editor.html">Tile Editor</a>, or they may be <a href="Art Importing.html">imported from an image file</a>.<br>
<br>
Levels are composed of two planes: Plane A (Foreground) and Plane B (Background, and in some cases, special moving floors).
These planes are further divided into "High" and "Low" portions by settings within the 16x16 Blocks.<br>
<br>
The Level Editor may be used to edit Plane A, Plane B, or its own "clipboard" plane.
The clipboard plane receives <a href="Art Importing.html">imported plane layout data</a>, but may also be drawn to manually as with Planes A and B. This data may then be pasted onto Plane A or B at any location.<br>

<a name="Drawing">
<b>Drawing to the Level</b><br>
<ul><br>To draw the currently-selected Chunk onto the currently-selected level plane,
                       <b>left-click</b> the desired location, or <b>hold the left mouse button and drag</b> across the desired area</ul>

<br>
<br>
<a name="Pasting">
<b>Pasting from the clipboard</b><br>
<ul><br>To paste the contents of the clipboard onto the currently-selected level plane,
                       move the cursor to the upper-left corner of the desired area, then <b>hold Ctrl and press P</b></ul>

<br>
<br>
<a name="Loop">
<b>Toggling "Loop" Tile</b><br>
<ul><br>In games that do not support a two-path level collision system, such as Sonic 1 and Sonic CD, "loops" are kept track of by
                       an array stored in the program that holds two Chunk
                       IDs per zone, specifying which two Chunks can act
                       as "loops". "Loop" Chunks in these game types should
                       be stored once with solidity traveling up the right
                       side, and should be immediately followed by a visually
                       identical copy with solidity traveling
                       down the left side. The Chunk must also be "flagged"
                       within the level layout. To do this, hover over the
                       Chunk and press <b>Spacebar</b>. When a Chunk is
                       "flagged", its ID shown by the "Chunk at Cursor" status
                       element will be followed by the word "(Loop)".
                       If the game's loop Chunk ID array must be modified,
                       the ID that
                       should be entered into the array is the
                       Chunk's real ID plus 0x80 (128). None of this applies
                       to games that use a two-path level collision system,
                       as those games use special objects to trigger collision changes instead</ul>

<br>
<br>
<a name="Selecting">
<b>Selecting or "Grabbing" a Chunk</b><br>
<ul><br>To select a Chunk for drawing, use the <b>A</b> and <b>Z</b> keys to
                    cycle through the list, <b>right-click</b> the map to "pick up"
                    the Chunk that is under the cursor's current position, or
                    use the <b>"Chunk Selector"</b> in the Tile Editor</ul>

<br>
<br>
<a name="Moving">
<b>Moving Around the Level</b><br>
<ul><br>To scroll around the level area, use the <b>Arrow
                          Keys</b> to scroll by the "scroll value", or use the
                          <b>scrollbars</b> surrounding the window. In full-screen
                          mode, moving the mouse pointer to the <b>edges of the
                          screen</b> will also scroll. When used in conjunction
                          with the Arrow Keys, the scroll speed will double</ul>

<br>
<br>
<a name="Resizing">
<b>Resizing the Level</b><br>
<ul><br><b>Holding Ctrl while pressing the arrow keys</b> will change
                     the level size. Left and Down increase Width and Height,
                     Right and Up decrease Width and Height. (This is level
                     data size, not gameplay boundary size. The in-game boundaries
                     are determined by another array, and are usually modified by program code during gameplay)</ul>

<a name="Editors">
<b>Switching Between Planes and Other Editing Modes</b><br>
<ul><br>The "Editors" menu has options to switch to any of the other
              editing modes available to a project using this editor.

<a name="S22P">
<b>Split-Screen Mode Compatibility</b><br>
<ul><br>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 features a split-screen competition mode that makes use
                     of the Megadrive/Genesis's "interlace mode" to double the screen's
                     vertical resolution. While using this mode, the system switches
                     from using 8x8 Tiles to 8x16 Tiles, so 16x16 Blocks must be set up in the following way:<br>
<br>
                     Within both columns of a 16x16 Block, the two 8x8 Tile entries
                     must be set to the same palette row and the same drawing priority.
                     Not following this rule will cause the graphics to display improperly,
                     because the Block now effectively has two 8x16 Tile entries instead of
                     four 8x8 Tile entries. In effect, this means that the game will only be reading the
                     settings for the two 8x8 Tile entries on the upper row, and applying them
                     to the two entries on the bottom row (Ex: The properties of the lower-left
                     Tile entry <i>must</i> be set equal to the properties of the upper-left Tile
                     entry for them to be displayed as they were designed,
                     because while in "interlace mode", those two Tiles become one double-height
                     Tile, and only the settings for the upper-left Tile entry will be read and
                     applied). These two settings cannot be compensated for through automated
                     conversion; care must be taken to follow this rule while initially designing
                     the level graphics and layout<br>
<br>
                     Using this option will, however, automatically re-arrange and duplicate the
                     Tiles as needed to construct a full set of proper 8x16 Tiles and compensate
                     for lower-row Tile entries using different draw direction settings than the
                     entry immediately above them<br>
<br>
                     Because of the nature of this video mode, performing this conversion can
                     sometimes dramatically increase the number of 8x8 Tiles. This can't be
                     helped, as while this creates many duplicate 8x8 Tiles, all of the tiles
                     are actually unique when regarded as 8x16, and are necessary to render
                     the level the way it was designed. Care should be taken to reduce the
                     number of 8x8 Tiles that are used in the initial production of the level
                     so that this process doesn't generate too many to be used in-game<br>
<br>
                     To perform this conversion, select the <b>"Make Level 2P Compat" option
                     in the "Editor" menu</b>. If any Block settings errors are detected,
                     they will be noted through the message system<br>
<br>
                     <i>In terms of the original, unmodified game programs, this mode is only
                     available in Sonic 2 (Sonic 3 uses normal resolution with smaller graphics).
                     The option is available at all times in the Level Editor, but it is not
                     designed to handle "Tile Paging", and so, the conversion will not be
                     performed when there is more than one 8x8 Tiles page</i>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<a name="Translucency">
<b>Translucent Cursor</b><br>
<ul><br>The Chunk cursor can be made translucent by selecting the
                     <b>"Translucent Cursor" option in the "Editor" menu</b>, so that
                     the Tile currently placed at the cursor's position shows
                     through the Tile that is currently selected for drawing.
                     This option is off by default, and may reduce performance
                     on old computer systems as it is slower to render</ul>
